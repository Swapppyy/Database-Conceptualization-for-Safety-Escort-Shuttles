# Database-Conceptualization-for-Safety-Escort-Shuttles

### Introduction
The Department of Public Safety database is designed to provide Syracuse University students with a safe and reliable ride service during midnight hours, specifically from 8 pm to 6 am. The database will be managed by the University's police department and will include important student details, such as their name, contact information, and current location.

The primary goal of this project is to ensure that students who are out late at night have a safe and convenient means of transportation back to their residences. Students can use the database to request a ride and specify their destination. The police department will then match the request with an available driver and supply the necessary information to ensure the ride is completed safely and efficiently.

The database will also include a map for drivers to find the student in need of a ride and provide details about the driver, such as their name, license number, and vehicle information. This additional information is intended to make students feel safe and comfortable during their ride.
